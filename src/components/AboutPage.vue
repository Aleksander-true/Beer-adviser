    <h1 class="title">Beer Adviser Project</h1>
    <p>
      The project was found between April 19, 1987 and December 31, 2999 by
      Homer Simpson and Bender Bending Rodr√≠guez.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, it was just the start-up of genious person and robot who just liked
      beer in a god-forsaken bar. It soon became clear that Homer's rich
      experience (more than 100 professions over 30 years) and Bender's
      artificial intelligence coupled with entrepreneurial talent made them the
      best beer advisors in the history of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, the Beer Adviser Project has grown into a global corporation
      with multibillion-dollar revenue and customers in all bars in the world,
      from Alaska to Chukotka and from Greenland to Antarctica.

    <h2 class="title">How it works</h2>
    <p>
      Our system is a self-learning neuro-biological, crypto-organic algorithm
      on a semi-quantum super-duper computer that works with Incredibly Big
      Data. The algorithm advises you on the perfect beer for today with a 142%
      accuracy rate, almost instantly
    </p>
    <h2 class="title">Usage</h2>
    <p>
      All you have to do is click on the big red button and the app will give
      you the best beer for you based on your age, position, and weekday of
      birth.
